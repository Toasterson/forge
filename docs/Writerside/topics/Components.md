# Components

A Component is used to define a Software that can be installed onto a System. In Forge
this means that a Component encompasses the Definition how to Build the Sources 
any patches required or desired by the Maintainers and any files not provided by the upstream Source.

In the Context of Forge the definition on what defines a source and which packages are built out of it is
not a fixed definition. This allows flexibility when needed to deliver one component in separate packages or 
deliver one package from two sources that could technically be independent components. The later case should be
used sparingly though as there is usually a good reason Software developers split their Software into multiple
components. Delivering multiple packages is more frequent, as the sources often contain multiple components
for ease of delivery to the Distributor
